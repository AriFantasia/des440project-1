      <p>Susanoo and Amaterasu had a long sibling rivalry. One day, Susanoo challenged Amaterasu. The challenge was who could make the most gods from objects.</p>

      <p>Susanoo used his sister’s necklace to create five goddesses,</p>

      <p>Enraged from his loss, Susanoo destroyed his sister’s rice fields, and threw a flayed divine horse through the roof of Amaterasu’s sewing room.</p>

  <div class="col-9">
      <p>Scared from the sight, Amaterasu hid herself in the heavenly rock cave.</p>

      <p>Without Amaterasu, the sun also disappeared.</p>

      <p>Eventually, Susanoo came to a village and met a grieving elderly couple who held their beautiful daughter, “What is wrong?” Susanoo asked.</p>

<div class="live-area">
  <div class="col-9">
      <p>“The dreaded serpent Yamato-no-Orochi, has come to this village each year to eat one of our daughters,” the man explained.</p>

      <p>“Soon, Orochi will be back to eat our eighth daughter,” the woman cried.</p>

  <div class="col-12">
      <p>Moved by their plight, Susanoo told the couple he will kill the serpent if he could marry their daughter. The couple agreed.</p>

  <div class="col-9">
      <p>“Before the serpent comes, brew your strongest sake. Place eight cups near the doorway of your house and fill it with the sake.”</p>

      <p>When Orochi came and smelled the sake, it could not resist and each of its eight heads drank from the cups.</p>

  <div class="col-12">
      <p>The serpent then fell into a drunken slumber, and Susanoo cut off each of the beast’s heads.</p>

<div class="live-area">
  <div class="col-9">
      <p>After cutting off the heads, Susanoo discovered a sword in the snake’s tail. The sword was called “Grass Cutter.”</p>

      <p>Susanoo presented the sword to his sister as an apology for his misdeeds.</p>
